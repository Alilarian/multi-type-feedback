## A Fork of: RL Baselines3 Zoo: A Training Framework for Stable Baselines3 Reinforcement Learning Agents

This is directly based on the [Stable Baselines3 Zoo](https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo) by Raffin et al.
TODO: In the future, we want to directly import rl_zoo3, and just keep our code. In theory this is already possible,
i think we mostly need to import our hyperparameter settings and a small number of adaptations for the exp manager.
